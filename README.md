Ducky payloads you can find here:  https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads

or here:   https://github.com/CedArctic/DigiSpark-Scripts

Or, you can simply write your own payloads using Ducky script

Ducky script syntax:                https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript

Recently we found the video "Digispark Flashing Guide & Ducky Payload Converters" that shows how to flash Digispark using the payloads generated by our script:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrn_hgckhGw&lc

Upd: added 3d models of USB flesh drive to hide Digispark. 

You could edit 3d model, or just print on 3d printer ready-for-print .stl models
